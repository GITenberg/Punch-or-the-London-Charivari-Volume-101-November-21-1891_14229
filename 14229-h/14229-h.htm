    <h4>CANCEL, OR RECALL.</h4>

    <p>The <i>World</i> last week sounded a note about the
    compulsory retirement, by reason of age, from one of the large
    Revenue Departments, of a gentleman who has the great honour to
    be the son of "the most distinguished Irishman of this
    century." If this sentence has really been passed
    authoritatively, which <i>Mr. Punch</i> takes leave to doubt,
    then said "Authority" will do well to recall it in favour of
    the son of the Liberator, which his name is also "DAN." And, to
    give the well-known lines so often quoted,&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>When DAN'L saw the writing on the wall,</p>

            <p>At first he couldn't make it out at all."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>And the sooner the official writing on the wall&mdash;if it
    exists&mdash;be obliterated, the better for the public service,
    as, when the public, like the Captain in the ballad of
    "<i>Billy Taylor</i>," "Comes for to hear on't," the said
    British Public will "werry much applaud what has been done" in
    suppressing, not issuing, reconsidering, or revoking the order.
    So says "Mr. P.," and the "B.P." will agree with him.</p>

    <h3>ROBERT ON THE LORD MARE'S SHO.</h3>

    <p>Well, I've had the grate good luck to have seen praps as
    menny Lord Mare's Shos as most peeple, praps more&mdash;not so
    menny, in course, as that werry old but slitely hexadgerating
    Lady, as bowsted as she had seen hunderds on 'em&mdash;but for
    sum things, speshally for Rain, and mud, and slush, the last
    one beats 'em all holler! What poor little Whales could have
    done to put the Clark of the Whether into sitch a temper, in
    course I don't know, but if he'd have had a good rattling
    attack of the gout in both big Tos, like some past Lord Mares
    as we has most on us heard on, he coudn't posserbly have bin in
    a wuss one.</p>

    <p>Praps them as most xcited my reel pitty was the LORD MARE'S
    six genelmen in their luvly new State liverries, and their
    bewtifool pink silk stockings a showing of their manly carves,
    all splashing along through the horful mud, and made crewel fun
    of by the damp and thortless crowd. The fust reel staggerer was
    the reel Firemen, about a thowsand on 'em, a marching along as
    bold as their brass Helmets. What did they care for the rain
    and the mud! and didn't they look as it they was a longing for
    a jolly grand Fire to bust out, jest to show us how easy it was
    to put it out, tho' they had lost their jolly Captin. Then
    there was the pretty Welch Milk Maids, in their chimbley-pot
    Hats, and their funny-looking custooms, all a being drawn by
    six horses, and having some Bards and Arpers to take care on
    'em, and lend 'em humberrellars to keep off the rain. Ah! won't
    they have sum nice little stories to tell all their frends when
    they gits back to Whales, inclewding their singing of wun of
    their hold Welch songs afore the LORD MARE and all his nobel
    gests in the evening. No wonder that they was so estonished and
    bewillderd that they quite forgot to take off their
    chimbley-pot Hats wile they was a singing. But their LORD MARE
    and countryman kindly forgave 'em all, and away they went
    rejoysing.</p>

    <p>Upon the hole, I'm quite reddy to bear my testimoney to the
    fack that, if we coud by any posserbility have left out the
    horful rain, and the mud, and the pore soaked and
    dismal-looking mothers and children, it woud have been about
    the werry finest looking Sho ewer seen. The Bankwet at nite was
    jest as good as ushal, and indeed rayther better, and just to
    sho how thuroly eweryboddy had recovered from his morning's
    drenshing, the compny acshally larfed at the LORD CHANCELLOR'S
    Speach, and cheered the LORD MARE to the Hekko!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> No. (<i>After reflecting</i>) No, I haven't.
    But I was greatly struck by its remarkably bold outline from
    below. Indeed, I dashed off a rough sketch of it on the back of
    one of my visiting cards. I ought to have it somewhere about me
    now. (<i>Searching himself.</i>) Ah, I thought so! (<i>Handing
    a vague little scrawl to</i> CULCHARD, <i>who examines it with
    the deepest interest.</i>) I knock off quite a number of these
    while I'm abroad like this. Send 'em in letters to relatives at
    home&mdash;gives them a notion of the place. They
    are&mdash;ar&mdash;kind enough to value them. (CULCHARD
    <i>makes a complimentary mumble.</i>) Yes, I'm a very rapid
    sketcher. Put me with regular artists, and give us half an
    hour, and I&mdash;ar&mdash;venture to say I should be on terms
    with them. Make it <i>three</i> hours, and&mdash;well, I
    daresay I shouldn't be in it.</p>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>who has dropped into the chair next
    to</i> Miss PRENDERGAST <i>and her brother</i>). BOB, old chap,
    I'll come in the middle, if you don't mind. I say, this
    <i>is</i> ripping&mdash;no idea of coming across you so soon as
    this. (<i>Lowering his voice, to</i> Miss P.) Still pegging
    away at my "penance," you see!</p>

    <p><i>Miss Prend.</i> The pleasure is more than mutual; but do
    I understand that Mr. &mdash;&mdash;? So <i>tiresome</i>, I
    left my glasses up in my room! [<i>She peers up and down the
    line of faces on her own side of the table.</i></p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>to Culch.</i>) I want you should notice
    that girl. I think she looks just as nice as she can be, don't
    you?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>carefully looking in every other
    direction</i>).
    I&mdash;er&mdash;mumble&mdash;mumble&mdash;don't exactly&mdash;
    [<i>Here a Waiter offers him a dish containing layers of soles
    disguised under thick brown sauce;</i> CULCHARD <i>mangles it
    with an ineffectual spoon. The Waiter, with pitying contempt,
    "Tut-tut-tut! Pesce Signore&mdash;feesh!"</i> CULCH.
    <i>eventually lands a sole in a very damaged condition.</i></p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>to Miss P.</i>) No&mdash;not this
    side&mdash;just opposite. (<i>Here</i> CULCH., <i>in fingering
    a siphon which is remarkably stiff on the trigger, contrives to
    send a spray across the table and sprinkle</i> Miss
    PRENDERGAST, <i>her brother, and</i> PODBURY, <i>with impartial
    liberality</i>). <i>Now</i> don't you see him? As playful as
    ever, isn't he! Don't try to make out it was an accident, old
    fellow. Miss PRENDERGAST knows you! [<i>Misery of</i>
    CULCHARD.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>graciously</i>). Pray don't apologise,
    Mr. CULCHARD; not the least harm done! You must forgive me for
    not recognising you before, but you know of old how provokingly
    shortsighted I am, and I've forgotten my glasses.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>indistinctly</i>). I&mdash;er&mdash;not at
    all ... most distressed, I assure you ... really no
    notion&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>in an undertone</i>). Say, you
    <i>know</i> her, then? And you never let on!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Didn't I? Oh, surely! yes,
    I've&mdash;er&mdash;<i>met</i> that lady. (<i>With grateful
    deference to</i> Mr. BELLERBY, <i>who has just addressed
    him.</i>) You are an Art-Collector? Indeed?
    And&mdash;er&mdash;have you&mdash;er&mdash;?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> I've the three finest Bodgers in the kingdom,
    Sir, and there's a Gubbins&mdash;a <i>Joe</i> Gubbins, mind
    you, not <i>John</i>&mdash;that's hanging now in the
    morning-room of my place in the country that I wouldn't take a
    thousand pounds for! I go about using my eyes and pick 'em up
    cheap. Cheapest picture <i>I</i> ever bought was a
    Prout&mdash;thirty-two by twenty; got it for two pound ten!
    Unfinished, of course, but it only wanted the colour being
    brought up to the edge. <i>I</i> did that. Took me half a day,
    and <i>now</i>&mdash;well, any dealer would give me hundreds
    for it! But I shall leave it to the nation, out of respect for
    PROUT'S memory.</p>

    <p><i>Bob Pr.</i> (<i>to</i> PODBURY). Yes, came over by; the
    St. Gothard. Who is that girl who was talking to CULCHARD just
    now? Do you know her? I say, I wish you'd introduce me some
    time.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> (<i>to</i> CULCHARD). You don't seem vurry
    bright this evening. I'd like you to converse with your friend
    opposite, so I could get a chance to chip in. I'm ever so
    interested in that girl!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Presently&mdash;presently, if I have an
    opportunity. (<i>Hastily, to</i> Mr. B.) I gather that you
    paint yourself, Sir?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> Well, yes. I assure you I often go to a
    Gallery, see a picture there that takes my fancy, go back to my
    office, and paint it in half an hour from memory&mdash;so lake
    the original that, if it were framed, and hung up alongside, it
    would puzzle the man who painted it to know t'other from which!
    I have indeed! I paint original pictures, too. Most important
    thing I ever did was&mdash;let me see now&mdash;three feet by
    two and three-quarters. I was most successful in getting an
    effect of rose-coloured snow against the sky. I sponged it up,
    and&mdash;well, it came right somehow. <i>Luck</i>, that was,
    not skill, you know. I sent that picture to the Royal Academy,
    and they did me the honour to&mdash;ar&mdash;reject it.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>vaguely</i>). An&mdash;er&mdash;honour,
    indeed.&mdash;(<i>In despair, as</i> Mr. B.
    <i>rises.</i>)&mdash;You&mdash;You're not <i>going</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> (<i>consolingly</i>). Only into the garden,
    for coffee. I observe you are interested in Art. We
    will&mdash;ar&mdash;resume this conversation later.</p>

    <p>[<i>Rises;</i> Miss PRENDERGAST <i>rises too, and goes
    towards the garden.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>as he follows, hastily</i>). I must get
    this business over&mdash;if I can. But I wish I knew exactly
    <i>how</i> much to tell her. It's really very
    awkward&mdash;between the two of them. I'm afraid I've been a
    little too precipitate.</p>

    <p><i>In the Garden; a few minutes later</i>.</p>

    <p><i>Miss Prend.</i> (<i>who has retired to fetch her glasses,
    with gracious playfulness</i>). Well, Mr. CULCHARD, and how has
    my knight performed his lady's behests?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> May I ask <i>which</i> knight you refer
    to?</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>slightly changing countenance</i>).
    Which! Then&mdash;you know there is another? Surely there is
    nothing in that circumstance to&mdash;to offend&mdash;or hurt
    you?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Offended? (<i>Considers whether this would be
    a good line to take.</i>) Hardly <i>that</i>. Hurt? Well, I
    confess to being pained&mdash;very much pained, to discover
    that I was unconsciously pitted&mdash;against PODBURY!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i>. But why? I have expressed no preference as
    yet. You can scarcely have become so attached to him that you
    dread the result of a successful rivalry!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). It's a
    loop-hole&mdash;I'll try it. (<i>Aloud.</i>) You have divined
    my feeling exactly. In&mdash;er&mdash;obeying your commands, I
    have learned to know PODBURY better&mdash;to see in him a
    sterling nature, more worthy, in some respects, than my own.
    And I know how deeply he has centred all his hopes upon you,
    Miss PRENDERGAST. Knowing, seeing that as
    I&mdash;er&mdash;<i>do</i>, I feel that&mdash;whatever it costs
    me&mdash;I cannot run the risk of wrecking
    the&mdash;er&mdash;life's happiness of so good a fellow. So you
    must really allow me to renounce vows accepted
    under&mdash;er&mdash;an imperfect comprehension of
    the&mdash;er&mdash;facts! [<i>Wipes his brow.</i></p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> This is quite too Quixotic. Reflect, Mr.
    CULCHARD. Is such a sacrifice demanded of you? I assure you I
    am perfectly neutral at present. I <i>might</i> prefer Mr.
    PODBURY. I <i>really</i> don't know. And&mdash;and I don't
    <i>like</i> losing one of my suitors like this!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Don't tempt me! I&mdash;I mustn't listen, I
    cannot. No, I renounce. Be kind to PODBURY&mdash;try to
    recognise the good in him ... he is so devoted to
    you&mdash;make him happy, if you can!</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>affected</i>). I&mdash;I really can't
    tell you how touched I am, Mr. CULCHARD. I can guess what this
    renunciation must have cost you. It&mdash;it gives me a better
    opinion of human nature ... it does, indeed!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>loftily, as she rises to go in</i>). Ah,
    Miss PRENDERGAST, <i>don't</i> lose your faith in human nature!
    Trust me, it is&mdash;er&mdash;full of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"
       id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span> surprises! (<i>Alone.</i>)
       Now am I an abominable humbug, or what? I swear I felt every
       word I said, at the time. Curious psychological state to be
       in. But I'm out of what might have been a very unpleasant
       mess at all events!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T. (coming upon him from round a corner).</i> Well,
    I'm <i>sure</i>, Mr. CULCHARD!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> You are a young lady of naturally strong
    convictions, I am aware. But what are you so sure of at the
    present moment?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I guess I'm not just as sure of
    <i>you</i> as I should like to be, anyway. Seems to me,
    considering you've been so vurry inconsolable away from me,
    you'd a good deal to say to that young lady in the patent
    folders. And I'd like an explanation&mdash;you're right down
    splendid at explaining most things.</p>

    <p><i>Culch. (with virtuous indignation).</i> So you actually
    suspect me of having carried on a flirtation!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I guess girls don't use their
    pocket-handkerchiefs that way over the weather. Who <i>is</i>
    she, anyway?</p>

    <p><i>Culch. (calmly).</i> If you insist on knowing, she is the
    lady to whom Mr. PODBURY has every prospect of being engaged. I
    hope your mind is at ease <i>now</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I expect my mind would have stood the
    strain as it was&mdash;so it's Mr. PODBURY who's her admirer?
    See here, you're going to introduce me to that girl right away.
    It's real romantic, and I'm perfectly dying to make her
    acquaintance!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Hum&mdash;well. She
    is&mdash;er&mdash;<i>peculiar</i>, don't you know, and I rather
    doubt whether you will have much in common.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, if you don't introduce me, I shall
    introduce myself, that's all.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> By all means. (<i>To himself.</i>) Not if
    <i>I</i> can prevent it, though!</p>

    intelligence that the Princess FREDERICA of Hanover would pass
    the winter months at Biarritz, a well-known watering-place
    almost on the border-land between Spain and France. This news
    was received with gratifying tokens of interest at every Court
    of Europe, and has been noted in innumerable communications
    passing privately between high personages. Then HENED comes
    upon the scene, and pompously makes an identical announcement
    as a piece of news! Far be it from us to take advantage of
    infirmity imposed upon a man by the idiocy of his godfathers
    and godmothers at his baptism. But we are compelled to ask,
    What can be expected from a man named HENED?</p>

    <p>Sir HENRY WOLFF still lingers in town, Bucharest, in the
    meantime, having to get along as best it may without a British
    Minister. In private circles likely to be well-informed, the
    delay is understood to arise directly out of the fact that Lord
    RANDOLPH CHURCHILL is now "beyond the reach of regular postal
    arrangements."</p>

    <p>"I wrote to tell GRANDOLPH about ARTHUR BALFOUR stepping
    into his old shoes as Leader of the House of Commons," says
    WOLFFY, showing his white teeth; "and, begad, I shall not leave
    Pall Mall till I hear what he says on the subject."</p>

    <p>What is this scandal we hear about the THINGUMMIES? The
    family are naturally reticent on the subject, but WHOSETHIS has
    furnished us with some particulars which we believe may be
    relied on. On Wednesday afternoon, at five minutes to three (as
    nearly as we can fix the time), Mrs. THINGUMMY was walking down
    Bond Street, when, just as she reached the point where, as the
    Directory says, "Here is Bruton Street," who should pass her
    but WHATSHISNAME. THINGUMMY, who, by a strange chance, happened
    to be passing in a Hansom cab, was a witness to the
    <i>rencontre</i>, and following up the clue, came upon
    particulars which WHATDYECALLIT informs us is likely to make a
    stir. Mr. GEORGE LEWIS, being a friend of all parties
    concerned, will not accept a retainer from either side.</p>

    <p>The <i>Daily News</i>, in its report of the opening of the
    Food and Cookery Exhibition at the Agricultural Hall,
    remarks:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        "It will not be the least attractive feature of the
        exhibition that samples may be tasted at nearly all the
        stalls. The exhibition includes samples of gas and asbestos
        stoves and kitchen ranges."
    </blockquote>

    <p>We have brought this announcement under the notice of a
    friend who knows what's what when he's out to luncheon, and are
    disappointed at his lack of enthusiasm. He says he doesn't care
    about taking his gas that way, and as for asbestos stoves he
    knows nothing more indigestible, unless it be a kitchen
    range.</p>

    the honour to represent.</p>

    the Dockyards, and no doubt you have&mdash;</p>

    been revealed to me in the kindest manner possible.</p>

    We like to tell the whole world what we can do.</p>

    <p><i>In. For. (drily).</i> Exactly, and teach your neighbours
    how to do it?</p>

    <p><i>Com. Gen. (gazing at his neglected work).</i> But if you
    know everything, why do you come to me?</p>

    <p><i>In. For.</i> Well, I thought if I got it first hand from
    the Commander of the Future, it would strengthen the opinion I
    have already formed of the unpreparedness of the British
    Empire. For I take it that the British Empire <i>is</i>
    unprepared?</p>

    <p><i>Com. Gen. (amused).</i> Why, certainly! I thought
    everybody knew that! If war were declared now, according to all
    the rules of the game, we ought to be absolutely ruined.</p>

    <p><i>In. For.</i> Dear me! I am sorry to hear it! But surely
    your Fleet is fairly strong?</p>

    <p><i>Com. Gen. (laughing).</i> What a joke! Oh, I dare say,
    ship for ship and gun for gun, we are more powerful than any
    other nation. But if hostilities broke out, our Fleet would be
    valueless. We should want every vessel to guard our island
    shores, and our commerce and colonies would have to shift for
    themselves.</p>

    <p><i>In. For. (with concern).</i> Dear me! This is very sad!
    But then you have an Army?</p>

    <p><i>Com. Gen. (with another burst of laughter).</i> What!
    Call our wretched force an Army! Why, to quote a writer, whose
    letters have been published in our leading journal, "Nobody
    could tell the Secretary of State for War how a force of forty
    thousand men, if it had to be supplemented for defensive
    purposes by Volunteers, could be supplied with ammunition for
    six weeks." Call our force an Army! Why, my dear Sir, the
    notion is absolutely ridiculous!</p>

    <p><i>In. For.</i> But does not such a state of things make you
    uneasy?</p>

    <p><i>Com. Gen.</i> Uneasy! Of course it does! Why, at a
    moment's notice, this grand old country might disappear for
    ever! Why we all feel that we are on the point of dissolution!
    We know that only a ninth-rate Power has to send a fleet to
    invade us, and we should have to submit&mdash;that we should be
    absolutely effaced, and be known in future as merely a
    geographical expression!</p>

    <p><i>In. For.</i> But surely this is
    lamentable&mdash;demoralising?</p>

    <p><i>Com. Gen.</i> I should rather think it was!&mdash;awfully
    demoralising!&mdash;(<i>Sound of telephone bell.</i>)&mdash;But
    will you pardon me? Some one wishes to speak to me from Head
    Quarters. I won't be a second.</p>

    <p><i>In. For.</i> Certainly. Pray see what it is.</p>

    <p><i>Com. Gen. (listening, and speaking through
    telephone).</i> What! Not really? Hurray!</p>

    <p><i>In. For.</i> Why, what is the news?</p>

    <p><i>Com. Gen. (excitedly).</i> Splendid! The Great Powers of
    Europe have simultaneously declared war against us! This will
    be grand!</p>

    <p><i>In. For. (in a tone of deep commiseration).</i> My poor
    fellow, this means ruin!</p>

    <p><i>Com. Gen.</i> Ruin! Rot! (<i>Through telephone.</i>) All
    right, will start to-night, and should be in Paris by Thursday,
    and at St. Petersburg at latest by the end of week. We can take
    Vienna and Berlin on our way home! I will be with the men at
    Portsmouth within an hour. Never mind our baggage; send it on
    afterwards.</p>

    <p>Of course I knew perfectly well what would happen after I
    had put forth the programme of my financial operations. I said
    at the time to my friend GUS BRUMMAGEM, "Mark my words," I
    said, "I shall have all the Crowned Heads of the world
    grovelling at my feet and imploring, actually imploring me to
    allow them to hand over their money and their ancestral regalia
    to me for investment. They're bound to do it. I know the
    beggars well, and a more grasping lot you couldn't find within
    a day's march of Holloway Gaol." Dear old GUS (Beau GUS he is
    always called on account of his singularly attractive
    appearance) went so far as to pooh-pooh what I said. I don't
    bear him any ill-will. Gus was always a bit of a courtier, and
    got his head turned for good, when the Japanese Prince CHI IKAH
    invited him to stay a week at his country house, and to act as
    godfather to the infant prince, KA CHOOKAH, the necessary
    ceremony haying been postponed for six months in order to allow
    GUS to get there in time. That, as I say, was the ruin of GUS,
    and since that time he has had an offensive way of giving
    himself not merely airs, but what I may call regular blasts in
    the company of men better than himself. He ought to recollect
    that he owes his start in life to the lucky chance that threw
    him in my way. If I hadn't appointed him Chairman of the Turp,
    Pin and Bolt Company, and Managing Director of the New
    Gatefringe Syndicate, Limited, he might still be engaged in
    sweeping out the tenth-rate office which was formerly the scene
    of his labours. But I never expect gratitude. I am content to
    do good to my fellow-creatures without the least hope of merely
    temporal reward. On this particular occasion I was right, as
    usual. Telegrams stamped with the coats-of-arms of all the
    principal dynasties of the world have been inundating me. For
    instance, H.R.H. the Hereditary Grand Duke of LEIBWEH has wired
    to me in the following terms, of which I have caused an
    accurate translation to be executed by my staff of paid
    short-hand clerks:&mdash;"Have on my faithful and
    with-joy-inspired subjects a tax of ten <i>reichsgulden</i>
    each after great on the part of my ministers reluctance
    imposed. Invest proceeds for me in the best to your wisdom
    known company, and without delay. Perfect confidence." Now I
    can assure His Royal Highness, who will look in vain for any
    other answer than this, that no power on earth, and least of
    all the cajoleries or menaces of the great and highly-placed
    shall induce me to depart by one jot or tittle from the course
    I have marked out for myself. And I take this occasion to
    assure all other potentates that I do not propose by any effort
    of mine to bring wealth to the foreigner. The welfare of the
    British people is my only care. For them, <i>but for no
    others</i>, my investments are open; to them alone I devote my
    unrivalled experience. And after this I trust I shall be
    troubled with no further importunities from abroad.</p>

    <p>I have to announce this week that I have formed The Croesus
    Club Company. I have, at immense expense, secured a splendid
    site in the very heart of the fashionable quarter of London.
    Building operations will begin immediately, and within the next
    three weeks the members will be housed in a Club-house
    unrivalled for comfort and luxury. Ten French <i>chefs</i> will
    preside over the kitchen, and house dinners at a minimum price
    of &pound;5 a-head will be served in the Ruby Hall to the
    strains of the Brass Potsdammer Buben Hussar Band, specially
    retained for the exclusive service of the Club. The first list
    of members will consist of 2000, and, in order to insure
    exclusiveness, the subscription will be fixed at &pound;500
    without any entrance fee. A list of the Provisional Committee,
    containing a Duke as Chairman and four Peers as ordinary
    members, will be issued at once. I have the authority of the
    Committee to receive subscriptions.</p>

    <p>I may point with pride to the fact that all the investments
    recommended by me have prospered, and the list of British
    millionnaires has been heavily increased. Canadian Boodlers
    fairly firm, but with a tendency to cross the border-line. No
    returns. I say, "Sell." M.T. Coffer Co. not very promising.
    (294 stk.; lim. pref., 19; mortg. deb., 44.) Clear out, if
    possible. Tight Rates Ry. Co. must be bought. But enough of
    this. All that is necessary is that correspondents should send
    remittances. The rest may be left to me.</p>

    <p><i>Editor.</i> And I think you have asked the Solicitors who

    <p><i>Ed.</i> If you please. One by one; and kindly impress
    upon them the value of my time.</p>

    <p><i>Chief Sub.</i> Certainly. But I think you will find they
    will get over their business pretty speedily. After they have
    gone, no doubt you would like to look at the Contents Bill,
    Sir?</p>

    <p><i>Ed.</i> Yes, please; and now send up the Lawyers.</p>

    <p>[<i>Exit</i> Chief Sub., <i>when the</i> Editor <i>returns
    to his writing, until interrupted by</i> First Solicitor.</p>

    <p><i>First Solor.</i> Sorry to intrude upon you when you seem
    to be busy, but it was your own idea that I should look you
    up.</p>

    <p><i>Ed.</i> Entirely. And now, Sir, perhaps you will kindly
    explain of what your client has to complain.</p>

    <p><i>First Solor.</i> Certainly. You said of the senior member
    of the Bounding Brothers of Bohemia, that, "although a very
    marvel of strength and grace, he could scarcely, after fifty
    years service in the ring, be described as a
    trap&egrave;ze-practising acrobat."</p>

    <p><i>Ed.</i> Well, surely that is a most complimentary
    allusion to his personality! What does he want more than to be
    "a marvel of grace and strength"?</p>

    <p><i>First Solor.</i> You say he can scarcely be described as
    a "trap&egrave;ze-practising acrobat."</p>

    <p><i>Ed.</i> Well, can he? Does he ever practise on the
    trap&egrave;ze?</p>

    <p><i>First Solor.</i> Well, no. But he might if he liked! You
    see his chief business is to stand at the base of the pyramid,
    at the apex of which is his smallest and lightest Bounding
    Brother. But he might use the trap&egrave;ze, I repeat, if he
    liked.</p>

    <p><i>Ed.</i> If what I hear is correct&mdash;it would have to
    be a strong one?</p>

    <p><i>First Solor.</i> Certainly&mdash;an extra strong one. We
    don't deny that our client weighs over twenty stone. But there,
    as we can accept no explanation, will you kindly tell me the
    name of your Solicitor?</p>

    <p><i>Editor.</i> Certainly.</p>

    <p>[<i>Gives the requisite information, and returns to his
    work, until interrupted by</i> Second Solicitor, <i>who has
    taken the place of the First.</i></p>

    <p><i>Second Solor.</i> I am afraid this interview is
    absolutely useless. Our client can accept no apology. You
    announced that you believed that JOHN SNOOKS had ceased to be
    in the employment of the Universal Cab and Fly Company.</p>

    <p><i>Editor.</i> Who is John SNOOKS?</p>

    <p><i>Second Solor.</i> He is a driver in the service of the
    organisation I have just named&mdash;and we act for the
    organisation. We complain that you have seriously injured us by
    telling the public that you believed we had lost the services
    of one of our thousand drivers.</p>

    <p><i>Editor.</i> But if we <i>did</i> believe it?</p>

    <p><i>Second Solor.</i> That is your business and not ours; and
    so, Sir, we shall be glad of the names of your Solicitors.</p>

    <p>[<i>The information is afforded, and the</i> Editor
    <i>returns to his work, until interrupted by</i> Third
    Solicitor.</p>

    <p><i>Third Solor.</i> Sorry to disturb you, but you have been
    libelling one of our clients. He objects to your putting his
    Christian name in the paper&mdash;says that even with another
    surname it will injure him with his neighbours. He doesn't want
    his Christian name to be figuring in the public prints.</p>

    <p><i>Ed.</i> And what is his Christian name?</p>

    <p><i>Third Solor.</i> ZOZIMUS.</p>

    <p><i>Ed.</i> Why, that is mine! I thought I was the only man
    in the world with that name, with the solitary exception of my
    godfather!</p>

    <p><i>Third Solor.</i> Very likely you are&mdash;your godfather
    is our client.</p>

    <p><i>Ed.</i> Then mustn't I print my own name?</p>

    <p><i>Third Solor.</i> Certainly not without running the risk
    of an action for libel. The address of your Solicitors,
    please?</p>

    <p>"<i>GUILLAUME DEUX</i>," says the <i>Figaro</i>, "<i>prend
    tr&egrave;s au s&eacute;rieux sa t&acirc;che de
    moralisateur.</i>" He is his own Licenser of plays, and, it may
    be presumed, collars the fees for doing the official Licenser's
    work; that is, if there be a department of this nature in the
    Lord Chamberlain's Office. And His Imperial Highhandedness not
    only is his own licenser, but is a self-appointed
    Stage-Manager, for, continues the <i>Figaro</i>, "<i>Il a
    pr&eacute;scrit que, dans une pi&egrave;ce moderne, LE NOUVEAU
    MAITRE, une sc&egrave;ne un peu violente ne f&ucirc;t pas
    jou&eacute;e &agrave; l'avant-sc&egrave;ne, mais au fond du
    th&eacute;&acirc;tre.</i>" If His Imperial Majesty should
    permit some of IBSEN'S plays to be performed, <i>Ghosts</i> for
    example, or <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, no doubt most of the dialogue
    would be given right at the back of the stage, out of ear-shot
    of the audience. In ordinary dramas the Villain who may have to
    use strong language, or in farce the Eccentric Comedian who
    frequently has to utter more or less playfully a meaningless
    "big big D," would by Imperial command be compelled to "retire
    up" to deliver himself of the expletive, and then would have to
    "come down to the front" and continue the stage-business. But,
    not satisfied with merely giving the above stage-directions,
    His Imperial Majesty "<i>est all&eacute; samedi s'assurer en
    personne que ses ordres &eacute;taient bien
    ex&eacute;cut&eacute;s.</i>" No dodging such an Emperor as
    this. How would Herr Von IRVING and Herr TOOLE like this
    personal supervision? And how about Herren JONES, PINERO, W.S.
    GILBERT and a few others, who would not particularly enjoy
    having their stage-directions upset by even an Imperial
    amateur. The next move of GUILLAUME DEUX will be to make
    himself honorary prompter, and it may be to cast himself for
    the leading parts.</p>

    <p>"<i>DICKENSII nihil &agrave; me alienum puto</i>," quoth the
    Baron, taking up <i>A Week's Tramp in Dickens-Land</i>. By W.K.
    HUGHES, F.L.S., with Illustrations by F.G. KITTON, and Others,
    published by Messrs. CHAPMAN AND HALL. Ahem! The frisky KITTON,
    having several tales to play with (probably some relation to
    the Cat-'o-nine-tails, eh?), has done his work well; and the
    same may be said for Others. The work can be recommended as a
    book of pictorial reference for Dickensian students, but
    otherwise it is&mdash;ahem&mdash;superfluous. If this kind of
    trading on the name of DICKENS continues, we shall probably
    become HUGHES'd to seeing such announcements as, "Shortly to
    appear,&mdash;<i>The Collected Bills of the Butcher and Baker
    of Charles Dickens</i>; <i>Upper Storeys of Houses in whose
    Neighbourhood Charles Dickens resided</i>; <i>Some Tradesmen's

    <p>A sad story, picturesquely commenced, and powerfully ended,
    is RUDYARD KIPLING'S <i>The Light that Failed</i>. But, between
    these two extremes, the conversations have the deadly fault of
    being wearisome, and, as to the manner of their conversation,
    were the Baron compelled to listen to much of it, life would
    indeed not be worth living. The women-kind in it are all
    detestable; there is none of them that doeth good in the novel,
    no, not one. It becomes gradually gloomier and gloomier, and,
    indeed, it is well styled <i>The Light that Failed</i>. Since
    DAUDET'S <i>Jack</i>, the Baron calls to mind no book more
    pitiful, no characters more heartless, and no sadder ending.
    Clever, of course; artistic, equally so; but&mdash;well, the
    Baron's advice to his enemies is, Go in heavily for Christmas
    festivities, have an orgy of plum-pudding, creams, sweets, and
    mince-pies, and, on the day after Boxing Day, stay indoors, and
    read <i>The Light that Failed</i>.</p>

    GRISELDA GAY undertake a considerable proportion of such
    seasonable reviewing as is more or less expected from the BARON
    DE BOOK-WORMS about this season of the year. But the Baron
    reviews the reviewers, and presents the public with only the
    pick of the basket. Now, once for all, the Baron gives notice
    hereby and herewith nevertheless and all to the contrary
    notwithstanding, that neither he nor his retainers will take
    notice of Christmas puzzles, such as, for example, the
    bilious-looking "Spots Puzzle," which ought to be dedicated to
    <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, as it is brought out by "WOLF."
    The Baron cannot listen to "the cry of WOLF." Let that he
    understood. Now, in the way of Books, what is there for
    Christmas fare? There is friend BLACKIE, who doesn't keep
    himself dark, but comes out with <i>Henty</i> in Plenty, whose
    <i>Dash for Khartoum</i> will be appreciated even by those who
    don't ordinarily care a dash for anything. Ask for HENTY, and
    see that you get him. Mr. MANVILLE FENN ought long ago to have
    changed his name to BOYVILLE FENN, as he is so associated with
    Books for Boys, and his <i>Brownsmith's Boy</i> is more boyant
    than ever. "A capital book" says the Baron's chief adviser.

    hand. "What is he doing, my boy?" inquires the Baron, of the
    hook-baiting boy. "He's ketching sumthink," whispers the
    urchin. Is it Historical Notes on the <i>Diet of Wurms</i>? Is
    it necessary to show that the fish have no consciousness of
    Pain? Or, is he composing <i>Lines to my Rod</i>? Or is it a
    disquisition on "ingratitude," showing how the stream goes on
    murmuring? And does he classically remind it how silent it
    ought to be,&mdash;<i>Dumb defluit annis</i>? Or does the
    stream murmur because our ANDREW the Fisherman has been
    "whipping" it? Should he betake himself to fly-fishing, let his

    <h3>MEMS FROM MONKEY-LAND.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        (<i>Being a Report made to the "Royal Simian Society" by
        Professor Hairy Myas, F.R.S.S., with compliments to
        Professor Garnier, who continues his articles on "a Simian
        Language" in "The New Review" for this month.</i>)
    </blockquote>

    <p>I have for some time past paid considerable attention to the
    sounds uttered by the Human Beings who are permitted to observe
    our movements, in the wire house which the Proprietor of these
    gardens has so obligingly placed at our disposal, rent free. My
    object has been to discover whether the Human Species, though
    belonging to a rather low form of animal life, can be said to
    have anything corresponding to the language which is the
    recognised means of communicating between Apes.</p>

    <div class="figright"

        <a href="images/252c.png"><img width="100%"

             </a>
    </div>

    <p>I have been much assisted in my investigations by the kind
    help afforded me by the great Anubis Baboon, who has frequently
    abandoned the consumption of nuts to come and make experiments
    on our human visitors; the elder members of the Chimpanzee
    Family have also been most useful, and have often restrained
    the young of their household from interrupting my inquiries by
    ill-timed pleasantries. Only once in the whole course of these
    scientific labours have I had seriously to complain of my tail
    being made use of as a swing.</p>

    <p>It was not long before I came to the conclusion that men do
    really mean something by the extraordinary gibberings and
    chatterings in which they indulge. My first experiment was on a
    female of the species, with a blue feather in her bonnet. At a
    sign from me, a young Chimpanzee suddenly and adroitly snatched
    the bonnet from her head. The sound she uttered was, as nearly
    as I can put it, <i>wh-oo-w!</i> ending in a shrill scream. I
    therefore take the <i>oo</i> sound to indicate alarm, or
    dissatisfaction. Exactly the same vowels were used by the
    Male.</p>

    <p>The mischievous young of the Human Species, we have
    discovered, also have this <i>oo</i> sound, and use it when
    they wish to frighten us.</p>

    <p>The three conclusions which I have drawn from my inquiries
    are:&mdash;</p>

    <p>1. That Human Beings understand the sounds they utter to
    each other, and therefore possess a language, as we do.</p>

    <p>2. That Human Beings have, in a very imperfect and
    rudimentary shape, the faculty of reason.</p>

    <p>3. <i>That Apes have descended from Men!</i> In other words,
    that a Monkey is only a highly-developed and more agile
    Man.</p>

    <p>These, no doubt, are startling conclusions, and I expect
    them to excite controversy. In fact, an Ourang-Outang friend of
    mine, to whom I mentioned them, was so shocked, that he has
    declined all nourishment ever since. But I rely on the
    scientific spirit of this great society to do me justice; and I
    venture to add a request that it will see fit to endow research
    by voting an extra supply of apples and nuts to the
    Chimpanzees, the Anubis Baboon, and myself, while we are at
    work on this very fatiguing field of inquiry.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
